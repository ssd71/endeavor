So between the last post and now, I bought a chair. Why is this important? I spent too much on it, so I have to justify it to someone in some form. Even if it's just me writing something for myself. Self expression at a certain level is healthy, no matter if somebody reads it(or not). That's not something I made up and no, I'm probably not crazy.

## Why a chair?

I risk my life every single day doing one of the world's most unhealthiest jobs i.e. sitting at a computer and copy-pasting from stackoverflow. As such, I face the risk of dangerous stuff like arthritis and being unable to stand up straight. Before this, I was sitting in a crappy upright chair that gave no way to my back, and was just straight up horrible. This, was how I had been doing things for 5 years before I realized that backache was a real problem. I concede that I am not very smart.

Things lead to other things and then those other things somehow lead me to buying a very expensive chair the very next day. Honestly, if given a chance, I would definitely buy a cheaper chair for my first time. considering how the chair cost me slightly less than 1/4th the cost of my computer. But hot damn! Does it do the job? Yes!

I will state something very clearly **do not** skimp on your chair if you are going to spend a lot of time sitting on it. Under **no** circumstances. I was suffering acute backache for years before I finally splurged, although while I am not completely happy with it, it doesn't leave me feeling like my backbone isn't intact anymore. If you are suffering from chronic back problems I **highly** suggest that you see a doctor, a chair might not work for you and the doctor can probably suggest what will.

## Finals season but I actually haven't studied shit

I am, as you may have guessed/found out via unscrupulous means, currently in my sophomore year. And I still haven't had my finals this semester. With COVID-19 going around, many notable colleges in my country are not having finals this season and people're getting grades that are similar to their previous semesters and quizzes/assignments from the current semester.

My university is a tad shittier than most others and has kept us in the dark ever since they told us not to come to class anymore. Until yesterday, that is, when I got an email that I had missed a 'class' on a website I didn't have an account on, which was, to put it mildly, suspicious.

After I reset my password to get into an account that I hadn't signed up for, I proceeded to head to 'my dashboard'. There, I was informed that I had 5 subjects in the current semester. Out of the five subjects, I only remember 'signing up' for 3 at the start of the semester, the rest were, like the rest of this fiasco, part of some bigger plan to bomb my grades for this semester and completely unknown to me, even though I had actually attended some classes this time. I expected to at least know what subjects I was going to have, at the start of the semester, but my college is exceptionally good at defying any and all expectations I have ever had, as it was this time.

This semester looks like a game of Russian Roulette to me, at this point.
